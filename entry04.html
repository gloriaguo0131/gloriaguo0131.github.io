            When i recall banff national park
            I remember the remote canadian wlderness.
            Majestic forests of pines, falling onto my shoulder.
            The abundance of animal wildlife,
            Longhorn sheep, moose walking by our car.
            I saw the stars last night sprawled across the sky.
            City girl has never felt so big, yet so small.
            It was there that i felt like something
            And also like nothing at all.

            When i recall CANADA
            I remember the remote canadian wlderness.

            When i recall NEW ZEALAND
            High in the sky i have been taken.
            Continuous as the stars that shine
            And twinkle on the milky way,
            They stretched in never-ending line
            Along the margin of a glacier:
            Ten thousands saw i at one glance,
            Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
