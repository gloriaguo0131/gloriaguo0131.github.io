            I always like to look at the night sky in silence
            See where everything belongs
            Forgive all the mistakes in the world again
            The silent stars accompany me to break away from the shackles of the world
            My dreams are like fireworks
            Blooming in an instant but disappearing into the lonely universe
            Like a shooting star falling in the world
            Daylight will escape in the arctic circle
            If the desolation of the earth could be summarized in human language
            The falling meteor will also kiss the outline of the clouds and mist
            The stars are falling, but the moon also ignites the legend
            Even if I seem cowardly
            Also have the courage to travel through the body
            See all the flowers bloom and fall
            But never flinched

            When i recall CANADA
            I remember the remote canadian wilderness.
            Majestic forests of pines, falling onto my shoulder.
            The abundance of animal wildlife,
            Longhorn sheep, moose walking by our car.
            I saw the stars last night sprawled across the sky.
            City girl has never felt so big, yet so small.
            It was there that i felt like something
            And also like nothing at all.

            If you have never seen the Milky Way
            You will not understand the loss that scholars feel when they look up at the stars
            Vast stars
            Which one is nurturing civilization?
            Which one is swallowed up by energy in fusion?
            If you have never seen the Milky Way
            Do you think that the night is just black and the moon is destined to be lonely?
            Even the light is dependent on the charity of the sun
            If you have never seen the Milky Way
            Maybe you will not be shitty like me
            It takes tens of billions of years for the universe to create stars
            And you and I are only a hundred years old

            I want all the blue in the world
            Want the starry night sky described by Van Gogh
            A blue mood that is close to 0 degrees Celsius
            The blue night is coming slowly
            To be the silent blue in the silent night
            Later I fell in love with all the blue colors in the world
            Love as free as the waves
            Love your blue eyes and ultramarine headband
            Love the fluttering blue spiders and butterflies, and the lingering moonlight
            I fall in love with eternity at the end of the universe
            and endless romance

            What that means is that far in the future,
            Some hundreds billion years from now.
            If intelligent life still exists in our galaxy,
            they will look out into space and see only the stars in our own milky way.
            All the other galaxies will have disappeared
            ang they will be alone in a vast dark empty expanse.

            "Starting from Saturn"
            Look up at the night sky
            Saturn guards the visible edge of the solar system
            Within the orbit of Saturn
            Time and space form a tight world
            As accurate as a clock
            development of things
            Strictly comply with karma, the law of cause and effect
            Cause leads to destined result
            Causal loop
            No matter how much time passes, there won't be any difference
            The future and destiny can be foreseen from the beginning
            Although life is regular and stable
            It is inevitably boring and lacks excitement.
            Visible world outside the boundaries
            There is a more invisible world
            A new world with more color, excitement and memories
            A life that is always the same
            Full of unknowns and uncertainties
            new life
            A life full of dreams and hopes
            The charm of life lies in its constant changes
            The greatness of life lies in the gathering of fate
            Let's try the unknowns and surprises in life
            Starting from Saturn.
